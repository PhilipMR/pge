## **What is PGE?**
PGE is a game engine designed around the creation of 3D top down action adventure games. More specifically, the engine is designed around the creation of a specific (as of yet untitled) game, but it should be flexible enough so that with minimal modification, it can be repurposed to make different games as well. 

The main goals of this project are:  
* Create and ship a high quality game
* Provide good looking portfolio material
* Provide a foundation upon which future games can be built

## **What is it *NOT***?
PGE is not a general purpose game engine like Unity or Unreal. As mentioned before the engine is designed around a specific game project. This means that the modeling and tooling of the engine might not immediately be suitable for all kinds of games.
